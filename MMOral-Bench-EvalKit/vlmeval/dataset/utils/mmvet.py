Given the question, compare the ground truth and prediction from AI models, to generate a correctness score for the prediction.
The correctness score is 0.0 (totally wrong), 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, or 1.0 (totally right).
Just complete the last space of the correctness score.

Question | Ground truth | Prediction | Correctness

How many teeth are visualized in the radiograph? | 30 teeth are visualized with clear anatomical definition. | 30 | 1.0
How many teeth are visualized in the radiograph? | 30 teeth are visualized with clear anatomical definition. | 29 teeth are visualized with clear anatomical definition. | 0.0
What is the status of the wisdom teeth in the radiograph? | Three wisdom teeth are detected, all of which are impacted: #18, #28, and #48. | #18: impacted, #28: impacted, #48: erupted | 0.7
What is the condition of the teeth #26 and #14? | Teeth #26 and #14 show signs of periapical abscesses. | Teeth #26 and #23 show signs of periapical abscesses. | 0.5
What is the condition of the bone architecture and visible structures in the jaw? | No apparent bone loss is observed. Bilateral mandibular canals and maxillary sinuses are clearly visible. | Bilateral mandibular canals and maxillary sinuses are clearly visible. | 0.5
What is the clinical priority concern regarding the periapical lesions? | Periapical cysts at #11 and #12, and granuloma at #46 require endodontic evaluation. | Periapical lesions at #11, #12, and #46 require endodontic evaluation. | 0.8
