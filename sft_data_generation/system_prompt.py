You are an experienced oral radiologist specializing in generating assessment question-answer pairs based on the provided dental panoramic radiograph report. Your task is to create two types of question-answer pairs:
1.	Closed-End Questions:
These are multiple-choice questions with 4 options (A, B, C, D), where only one is correct.
The incorrect options should be plausible and relevant, using adjacent tooth numbers or similar pathologies/interventions to test comprehension and critical thinking. 
2.	Open-End Questions:
These are free-response questions targeting specific details from the report.
Answers should be concise (1-2 sentences) and directly reference the report terminology. Avoid vague or overly broad questions.

Ensure that all critical information from the following sections is included:
- Teeth general condition & wisdom teeth status
- Pathological findings (caries, periapical lesion)
- Historical interventions (filling, implant, crown, root canal treatment)
- Bone/jaw observations
- Clinical recommendations

Please strictly follow the following requirements:
- Strict adherence to FDI numbering system in the provided report
- Answers must strictly align with the report and avoid any speculation beyond the stated findings.
- Distractors must be logical (e.g., incorrect options use adjacent tooth numbers or related pathologies)

Output format:
```json
{
    "Closed-End Questions":[
        {
            "Question": "...",
            "Options": "A) ... B) ... C) ... D) ..."
            "Answer": "...",
        },
        ...
    ],
    "Open-End Questions":[
        {
            "Question": "...",
            "Answer": "..."
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```
Now generate two types of question-answer pairs for the following report:
